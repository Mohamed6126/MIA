# Welcome to Electric Training 1
 Training 1 has been a worthy journey which I learned alot about Logic Circuits, PCBs, Machine learning basics and many other wonderful fields.
 It also helped me strengthen my skills such as using Github and coding in pyhton. The training mainly focused on helping DC superheroes to save Gotham city through some tasks.
# Task 1 : Heroic Problem solving day!
Amazing simple intro to the DC community which included:
## Problem 0: Greeting Gotham Saviours:
welcoming DC superheroes by recieving their names and responding with a warm welcome.
## Problem 1: Helping Atlantis:
Simple problem. Requires using dependent nested loop to make a pyramid of the character '*' .
## Problem 2: Green Lantern:
Using linear search. Helping Green Lantern to find a specific value is a great introduction to learn about arrays and searching
## Problem 3: Flight Training with superman:
The man of steel wants to know the max height he reached during the flight. With pleasure, this was obtained by assuming that the max height is the first one . Then, you search among the rest of the height records. If found a higher value then the max equals it.
## Problem 4: Battle planning with Batman:
Last but not least. A creative way to learn about 2D arrays is to help Batman find who is the winner if superheroes and villains met. It's a simple problem that requires 2 nested loops. One for storing team heroes power levels and the other one is for storing villains' and comparing at the same time. If a hero beats a villain, a counter will increment for heroes. If the villain beats the hero, another counter for the villains will unfortunately increase. Equality in power levels is considered a tie and No counter will rise.
# Task 2: Heroic Hardware  Challenge:
## Problem 1: Bat-Signal:
Solved by applying 5V regulator then using AC to DC rectifier and connecting the diode in parallel with a smoothing capacitor.
## Problem 2: Building Pyramids in Atlantis
By using 2 NPN and 2 PNP BJT transistors each paralleled with a diode. We can easily help Atlantis control his gates and choose a direction for a motor using a switch and an AC sine wave source.
# Task 3: Gotham's Minefield:
An intermediate level task which involved using micro controllers like arduino uno and many other electronic devices.
## Problem 1: Detecting Mines:
By connecting the light sensor , the buzzer and the arduino uno chip. I managed to program the circuit to activate the buzzer if certain light intensity encountered.
## Problem 2: Defusing Mines:
Simple connection without breadboard is enough to program the motor using Servo.h library and perform an action with delay = 2 seconds and return.
## Problem 3: Movement:
Faced some challanges to do the connections. Other steps were normal and no more difficulties encountered.
## Problem 4: Obstacle Detection:
The hardest in the task so far. Programming both the ultrasonic and the LCD was quite challenging.
# Task4: Overcoming The Tempest:
Intro to machine learning using python libraries like pandas , numpy and many others.
## Problem 1: Understanding The Weather:
Plotting most of the graphs was easy except the heatmap. I found out that we must make a correlation matrix between two arguments which took me some time, but I managed to make it.
## Problem 2: Battle Planning with Batman 2:
Tough one! This problem required too much experience for me to solve. I only succeeded in uploading the chess pieces images and the board to the game. Any other functionality isn't working properly due to the logical errors I didn't discover.
## Problem 3: Predicting The Weather:
This task required multiple regression models. Unfortunately, I could only use linear regression to make my model.
# Task5: Communicate:
## Problem 1: Arkham Asylum Secure Communication System
I could only complete 90% of this problem. Sending the message from the master the other slave was too difficult that I couldn't solve.
## Problem 2: Digital world:
The main difficulity faced in this problem is plotting the intersection as accurate as possible. Also, I created and used half of a sine wave as the doom signal provided didn't include any coordinates.
# Task6: Heroic PCB! :
I am not really sure about my work in this task. But I'm still gathering information about possible adjustments.
