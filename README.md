# Welcome to Electric Training 1
 Training 1 has been a worthy journey which I learned alot about Logic Circuits, PCBs, Machine learning basics and many other wonderful fields.
 It also helped me strengthen my skills such as using Github and coding in pyhton. The training mainly focused on helping DC superheroes to save Gotham city through some tasks.
# Task 1 : Heroic Problem solving day!
Amazing simple intro to the DC community which included:
## Problem 0: Greeting Gotham Saviours:
welcoming DC superheroes by recieving their names and responding with a warm welcome.
## Problem 1: Helping Atlantis:
Simple problem. Requires using dependent nested loop to make a pyramid of the character '*' .
## Problem 2: Green Lantern:
Using linear search. Helping Green Lantern to find a specific value is a great introduction to learn about arrays and searching
## Problem 3: Flight Training with superman:
The man of steel wants to know the max height he reached during the flight. With pleasure, this was obtained by assuming that the max height is the first one . Then, you search among the rest of the height records. If found a higher value then the max equals it.
## Problem 4: Battle planning with Batman:
Last but not least. A creative way to learn about 2D arrays is to help Batman find who is the winner if superheroes and villains met. It's a simple problem that requires 2 nested loops. One for storing team heroes power levels and the other one is for storing villains' and comparing at the same time. If a hero beats a villain, a counter will increment for heroes. If the villain beats the hero, another counter for the villains will unfortunately increase. Equality in power levels is considered a tie and No counter will rise.
